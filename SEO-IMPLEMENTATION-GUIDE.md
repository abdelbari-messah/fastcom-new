After deploying, verify these files are accessible:

- `https://fastcom.ma/robots.txt`
- `https://fastcom.ma/sitemap.xml`

### Step 2: Verify Your Website with Google Search Console

**This is ESSENTIAL - Google won't index your site properly without this!**

1. **Go to Google Search Console:**

   - Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Add Your Property:**

   - Click "Add Property"
   - Enter: `https://fastcom.ma`
   - Choose verification method:

   **Option A: HTML File Upload (Recommended)**

   - Download the verification file Google provides
   - Upload it to your FastCom folder: `/FastCom/google[...].html`
   - Click "Verify"

   **Option B: HTML Tag**

   - Copy the meta tag Google provides
   - Add it to the `<head>` section of `home-1.html`
   - Click "Verify"

3. **Submit Your Sitemap:**
   - Once verified, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

### Step 3: Register with Other Search Engines

**Bing Webmaster Tools:**

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Set Up Google Analytics (Highly Recommended)

1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com
2. Create a new property for `fastcom.ma`
3. Get your tracking code
4. Add it to **ALL** HTML pages before `</head>`

Example code to add:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());
  gtag("config", "G-XXXXXXXXXX");
</script>
```

## üîç Additional SEO Improvements Needed

### Priority: HIGH - Do These Soon

1. **Update Remaining HTML Pages**
   All these pages still need SEO meta tags:

   - `service.html`, `service2.html`, `service3.html`, `service4.html`
   - `project-1.html` through `project-7.html`
   - `publication-1.html` through `publication-6.html`
   - `404.html`

2. **Add Alt Text to Images**
   Many images are missing descriptive alt text. Example:

   ```html
   <!-- Bad -->
   <img src="img/photo/p3.jpeg" alt="team" />

   <!-- Good -->
   <img
     src="img/photo/p3.jpeg"
     alt="√âquipe FastCom - Agence marketing Casablanca"
   />
   ```

3. **Fix Internal Links**
   Ensure all internal links use relative paths and work correctly.

4. **Add Social Media Links**
   Update the social media links in the structured data (currently placeholder):
   - Facebook: Update in `home-1.html` structured data
   - Instagram: Add your actual profile

     - Pages Jaunes Maroc
     - Morocco business directories
     - Maroc.ma business listings

7. **Optimize Page Speed**
   - Compress images (many are large)
   - Minify CSS/JS files
   - Enable caching

### Priority: LOW - Nice to Have

8. **Add FAQ Schema**
   Add FAQ structured data to relevant pages.

9. **Create Video Content**
   Videos improve engagement and SEO.
